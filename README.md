# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone

This repository contains the Capstone I worked on during the Google Data Analytics Course.

The Capstone involved analysing any dataset and presenting our findings.

I worked on the Top 50 Best selling books of Amazon from 2009-19 to answer the following questions;
<li>Which genre of book sells more every year?</li>
<li>Are Fictional novels more popular than Non-Fiction or vice versa?</li>
<li>Are there any external factors other than reviews and price that contribute to high popularity?</li>
<ul>  </ul>





The .pdf file has the report about this project.
